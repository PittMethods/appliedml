## Course Communication

Important announcements will be emailed to registered attendees. However, attendees are strongly encouraged to join the course's Slack workspace. This workspace will provide a place for questions, answers, comments, and other discussions to occur in a more permanent place. We will monitor the Zoom chat window but this disappears when you leave a meeting, so Slack is the preferred method for communication. There will be several channels for discussion different topics (i.e., `general`, `questions`, `resources`, `panel-topics`, and `random`). More personal or sensitive communications should occur via email or Slack direct messages.

- An invitation to join this Slack workspace was emailed to registered attendees.
