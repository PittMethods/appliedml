## Goals and Timeline
.pull-left[
#### Workshop Goals
Build a foundation of concepts and skills

Describe every step from start to finish

Emphasize the practical and applied aspects

Provide intuitions rather than lots of theory

Dive deeper into a smaller number of algorithms

Highlight the algorithms "best" for this audience

Communicate the pros and cons of different choices

# Small Group Icebreakers
---
## Icebreakers
We will randomly assign everyone to one of two breakout rooms

Each breakout room will be led by one of the instructors

Each person will have *up to one minute* to introduce themselves

In addition to sharing your name, please answer these questions:

1. Where are you joining us from?
2. What field(s) do you work in?
3. What is one of your research interests?
4. What is one of your personal interests?

The instructor will go first and call on attendees to go next

If you would prefer not to share, please indicate that in chat
