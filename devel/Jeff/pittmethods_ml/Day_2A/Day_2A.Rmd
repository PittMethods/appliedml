## Motivation

**Features** are descriptions of the data points that help to predict the labels

- We may need to extract features from "raw" or "low-level" data (e.g., images)
- We may need to address issues with missing data and feature distributions

--

There are many potential ways to **encode** or "represent" the features

- e.g., adding, dropping, transforming, and combining features<sup>1</sup>
- Feature encoding can have a big ![:emphasize](impact on predictive performance)<sup>2</sup>
- The optimal encoding depends on both the **algorithm** and the **relationships**

.footnote[
[1] Some algorithms can learn their own, complex feature representations<br />
[2] Some algorithms are more sensitive to feature encoding than others

# Adding Features

class: onecol
## Calculated Features

Some variables will need to be calculated from existing values and variables

- You may choose to score an instrument from item-level data
- You may choose to encode a feature as the ratio of two values
- You may choose to calculate sums, means, counts, proportions, etc.

We will provide some example code in `base` R and `tidyverse` formats

But to learn more about data wrangling in R, we recommend the following

- <i>[R for Data Science: Visualize, Model, Transform, Tidy, and Import Data](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)</i><br />by Wickham and Grolemund (book for purchase or online for free)

---
## Calculated Features in R
```{r}
# Read in and partition the data
set.seed(2021)
trainIndex <- caret::createDataPartition(iris$Species, p = 0.8, list = FALSE, times = 1)
irisTrain <- iris[trainIndex, ]

# Add calculated features using base R
irisTrain$Avg.Length <- (irisTrain$Sepal.Length + irisTrain$Petal.Length) / 2
irisTrain$Width.Ratio <- irisTrain$Sepal.Width / irisTrain$Petal.Width
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(irisTrain) %>% 
  kableExtra::scroll_box(height = "250px")
```

---

## Calculated Features in R

```{r}
# Add calculated features using tidyverse
library(tidyverse)
irisTrain <- irisTrain %>% 
  mutate(
    Avg.Length = (Sepal.Length + Petal.Length) / 2,
    Width.Ratio = Sepal.Width / Petal.Width
  )
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(irisTrain) %>% 
  kableExtra::scroll_box(height = "250px")
```

## Categorical Features

Categorical features can be re-encoded into multiple binary (0 or 1) features

Imagine a categorical variable ** `age` ** that is either *Child* or *Adolescent* or *Adult*

--

.pull-left[
.center[![:emphasize](Dummy Coding)]

Group | age1 | age2
:-----|:----:|:----:
Child | 0  | 0
Adolescent | 1 | 0
Adult | 0 | 1

<p style="text-align:center;font-size:20px;">Efficient and avoids redundancy<br />Good for GLM-based methods</p>
]

.pull-right[
.center[![:emphasize](One-Hot Encoding)]

Group | age1 | age2 | age3
:-----|:----:|:----:|:----:
Child | 1  | 0  | 0
Adolescent | 0 | 1 | 0
Adult | 0 | 0 | 1

<p style="text-align:center;font-size:20px;">Simple and easy to interpret<br />Good for tree-based methods</p>
]

class: onecol
## Categorical Features in R
If you save a categorical variable as a factor in R, it will dummy code it by default

But we can also explicitly dummy code it using `caret::dummyVars()`

```{r}
data(etitanic, package = "earth")
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(etitanic) %>% kableExtra::scroll_box(height="275px")
```

---
class: onecol
## Categorical Features in R

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Dummy Coding
dummy <- caret::dummyVars(survived ~ ., data = etitanic, fullRank = TRUE) #<<
predict(dummy, newdata = etitanic)
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
dummy <- caret::dummyVars(survived ~ ., data = etitanic, fullRank = TRUE)
predict(dummy, newdata = etitanic) %>% 
  knitr::kable() %>% 
  kableExtra::scroll_box(height="300px")
```

---
class: onecol
## Categorical Features in R
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# One-Hot Encoding
onehot <- caret::dummyVars(survived ~ ., data = etitanic, fullRank = FALSE) #<<
predict(onehot, newdata = etitanic)
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
onehot <- caret::dummyVars(survived ~ ., data = etitanic, fullRank = FALSE)
predict(onehot, newdata = etitanic) %>% 
  knitr::kable() %>% 
  kableExtra::scroll_box(height="300px")
```

## Zero and Near-Zero Variance Predictors
![:emphasize](Zero variance predictors) take on only a single value in the sample

- These predictors are **uninformative** and may lead to **modeling problems**

![:emphasize](Near-zero variance predictors) take on only a few unique values with low frequencies

- These predictors can easily become zero-variance predictors during resampling

<p style="padding-top:25px;">For many algorithms, we want to <b>detect</b> and <b>remove</b> both types of predictors</p>

For algorithms with built-in feature selection, this should happen automatically

---
## Zero and Nero-Zero Variance Predictors in R

```{r}
# Simulate some predictors with acceptable, near-zero, and zero variance
set.seed(2021)
example <- tibble::tibble(
  x1 = rbinom(100, 1, prob = 0.50),
  x2 = rbinom(100, 1, prob = 0.99),
  w1 = rbinom(100, 5, prob = 0.20),
  w2 = rbinom(100, 5, prob = 0.00)
)
# Preview the simulated predictor variables
glimpse(example)
```

---
## Zero and Nero-Zero Variance Predictors in R

```{r}
# Detect the column numbers of variables with near-zero variance
nzv <- caret::nearZeroVar(example)
nzv
```

--

```{r}
# Show the metrics used for detection
caret::nearZeroVar(example, saveMetrics = TRUE)
```

--

```{r}
# Drop the zero and near-zero variance predictors
example2 <- example[, -nzv]
```

---
## Zero and Nero-Zero Variance Predictors in R

```{r}
# Drop zero variance predictors using preProcess
preProcess(example, method = "zv")
```

--

```{r}
# Drop near-zero variance predictors using preProcess
preProcess(example, method = "nzv")
```

.footnote[[1] Note that preProcess() will ignore non-numeric variables, so dummy code categorical variables first.]

## Recommendations

Algorithm | Preprocessing Steps
:-------- | :------------------
Regularized Regression | `dummy`, `nzv`, `impute`, `decorrelate`, (`transform`)
Decision Tree | (`decorrelate`)
Random Forest | (`nzv`), (`impute`), (`decorrelate`)

For these algorithms, normalization is only really necessary for interpretation

However, other algorithms (e.g., MLP and SVM) may require normalization
