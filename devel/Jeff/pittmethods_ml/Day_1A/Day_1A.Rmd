# Conceptual Introduction
---
class: onecol
## What is machine learning?

The field of machine learning (ML) is a **branch of computer science**

ML researchers **develop algorithms** with the capacity to ![:emphasize](learn from data)

When algorithms learn from (i.e., are **trained on**) data, they create **models**<sup>1</sup>

<p style="padding-top:20px;">This workshop is all about applying ML algorithms to create ![:emphasize](predictive models)</p>

The goal will be to **predict unknown values** of important variables **in new data**

.footnote[
[1] ML models are commonly used for prediction, data mining, and data generation.
]


---
class: twocol

.pull-left[
## Labels / Outcomes
Labels are variables we ![:emphasize](want to predict)<br />the values of (because they are unknown)

Labels tend to be expensive or difficult to measure in new data (though are known in some existing data that we can learn from)

AKA outcome, dependent, or $y$ variables

```{r label_icons, echo=FALSE}
include_graphics("label_icons.png")
```

]
--
.pull-right[
## Features / Predictors
Features are variables we ![:emphasize](use to predict)<br />the unknown values of the label variables

Features tend to be relatively cheaper and easier to measure in new data than labels (and are also known in some existing data)

AKA predictor, independent, or $x$ variables

```{r feature_icons, echo=FALSE}
include_graphics("feature_icons.png")
```

]

---
class: twocol

## Modes of Predictive Modeling
.pull-left[
When labels have continuous values, predicting them is called ![:emphasize](regression)

```{r regression_diagram, echo=FALSE}
include_graphics("regression_diagram.png")
```

- *How much will a customer spend?*
- *What GPA will a student achieve?*
- *How long will a patient be hospitalized?*
]
--
.pull-right[
When labels have categorical values, predicting them is called ![:emphasize](classification)

```{r classification_diagram, echo=FALSE}
include_graphics("classification_diagram.png")
```

- *Is an email spam or non-spam?*
- *Which candidate will a user vote for?*
- *Is a patient's glucose low, normal, or high?*
]

.footnote[*Unsupervised learning* (AKA data mining) has no explicit labels and just looks for patterns within the features.]

# Signal and Noise
---
class: onecol

## A Delicate Balance

Any data we collect will contain a mixture of **signal** and **noise**

- The "signal" represents informative patterns that generalize to new data
- The "noise" represents distracting patterns specific to the original data

We want to capture as much signal and as little noise as possible

--

<p style="padding-top:30px;">More complex models will allow us to capture <b>more signal</b> but also <b>more noise</b></p>

![:emphasize](Overfitting): If our model is too complex, we will capture unwanted noise

![:emphasize](Underfitting): If our model is too simple, we will miss important signal

## A Super Metaphor
.pull-left[
What makes machine learning so amazing is its **ability to learn complex patterns**

However, with this great power and flexibility comes the looming **danger of overfitting**

Thus, much of ML research is about finding ways to **detect** and **counteract** overfitting

For detection, we need two sets of data:

![:emphasize](Training set): used to learn relationships

![:emphasize](Testing set): used to evaluate performance

## Conclusions from Example
In ML, ![:emphasize](bias) is a lack of predictive accuracy in the original data (the "training set")

In ML, ![:emphasize](variance) is a lack of predictive accuracy in new data (the "testing set")

--

<p style="padding-top:25px;">An ideal predictive model would have both low bias and low variance</p>

However, there is often an inherent <b>trade-off between bias and variance</b><sup>1</sup>

.footnote[[1] To increase our testing set performance, we often need to worsen our performance in the training set.]

<p style="padding-top:25px;">We want to find the model that is <b>as simple as possible</b> but <b>no simpler</b></p>

### Question 1
**Is Sam done with this ML project?**

a) Yes, he should sell this model right now!

b) No, he needs to create a training set

c) No, he needs to test the model on new data

d) No, his model needs to capture more noise

### Question 2
**Which problems has Sam already addressed?**

a) Overfitting

b) Underfitting

c) Variance

d) All of the above

## Cross-Validation
There are some clever algorithmic tricks to prevent overfitting

- For example, we can penalize the model for adding complexity

The main approach, however, is to use ![:emphasize](cross-validation):

--

- Multiple **fully independent** sets of data are created (by subsetting or resampling)

- Some sets are used for training (and tuning) and other sets are used for testing

- **Model evaluation is always done on data that were not used to train the model**

- This way, if performance looks good, we can worry less about variance/overfitting<sup>1</sup>

.footnote[[1] Although we always need to worry somewhat about whether the original data was itself representative.]

## Advanced Cross-Validation
Cross-validation can also be **nested** to let the model tune on unseen data:

 - An outer loop (applied to the original data) is used for *model evaluation*

 - An inner loop (applied to the training set) is used for *model tuning*

Cross-validation can also be **stratified** to keep the sets relatively similar

Cross-validation can also be **repeated** to avoid problems with any single split

.footnote[A great default procedure is nested, stratified, and 3x repeated 10-fold cross-validation.]

We will randomly assign you to a small breakout room

We will jump between rooms to join discussions and answer questions

**Introduce yourselves again and discuss the following topics**

 1. What types of labels and features would you like to work with?

 2. What problems might predictive modeling help your field solve?

 3. Do you have any questions or comments about the material so far?
