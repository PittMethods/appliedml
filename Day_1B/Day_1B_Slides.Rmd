##How do we implement machine learning in R?

There are ![:emphasize](many packages) for building and evaluating machine learning models in R. 

Each implements specific ML models (e.g., {glmnet} for lasso, ridge, and elastic net regularization, {rpart} for decision trees, {randomforest} for random forests).

These packages were built by different people over time, so ![:emphasize](syntax and conventions differ).

This can be confusing to remember!

--

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.height="70%", out.width="70%"}
include_graphics("syntax_diff.png")
```

---
##{caret}

Recognizing the need for ![:emphasize](standardizing and streamlining) the process of building and evaluating machine learning models, Max Kuhn and others developed the `caret` (**C**lassification **A**nd **RE**gression **T**raining) package. 

This package allows researchers to quickly build and compare many different models.

There are 200+ machine learning models available in `caret`.

--

`caret` includes functions for:
- data visualization
- data pre-processing
- feature selection
- data splitting
- model training & testing
- variable importance estimation

---
##{caret}

.pull-left[
The `train()` function is the primary function for training models and tuning hyperparameters.

This ![:emphasize](same function and syntax) is used to train any and all machine learning models.

Users can also specify tuning parameter values and resampling method (e.g., *k*-fold cross-validation) with the `trainControl()` function.
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("caret_train.png")
```
]

--
</br>
```{r}
iris_fit <- train(Species ~., data = iris,
                  method = 'glmnet',
                  trControl = trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10))
```

---
##{caret}

Because `caret` has historically been the most popular package for machine learning in R, there are many freely available resources, solutions, and answers to questions online.

--

.pull-left[
```{r, echo = FALSE}

```

.pull-right[
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.height = "48%", out.width="48%"}
include_graphics("appliedpredictivemodeling.png")
```
]

---
## {tidymodels}

The newer {tidymodels} package is the `tidyverse` version of {caret}. Both packages were developed by the same author (Max Kuhn)! {tidymodels} is a ![:emphasize](meta-package) and includes a collection of many packages:

- `rsample` for data splitting and resampling
- `recipes` for pre-processing
- `parsnip` for trying out many models
- `workflows` to streamline the pre-processing, modeling, and post-processing
- `tune` to optimize model hyperparameters
- `yardstick` for model performance metrics
- `broom` for converting information to user-friendly formats
- `dials` for creating and managing tuning parameters

--

We will use the older `caret` but incorporate *aspects* of the newer `tidymodels`<sup>1</sup>
- This will give us access to some new features without overwhelming beginners
- It will also ease the transition to `tidymodels` if you decide to go that route

.footnote[[1] We will use `recipes` and `yardstick` but not `workflows`, `rsample`, `tune`, `parsnip`, or `dials.`]

# Simple Holdout Set

---
##Why EDA on training data only?

The **ultimate goal** of exploratory data analysis is to ![:emphasize](gain insights into  data to make informed modeling decisions). 

We split our data into training and testing subsets to evaluate the accuracy of our model in predicting *unseen* data. 

This gives us a sense for how our model might perform in the **future** on new datasets.

--

</br> 
If modeling decisions are made based on data patterns we observe in the test set, we ![:emphasize](risk artificially inflating model performance) estimates in the test set. 

**When possible, it is ideal** to perform exploratory data analysis only on your training data only.

But note that doesn't mean we can't check the test data for coding errors or data anomalies!

---
##Simple Train/Test Split

```{r, echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("datasplit_simple.png")
```

---
##Data Splitting

An important note on terminology beyond simple train/test data splits<sup>1</sup>: 

- **Training**: The data subsample used to explore the data and fit the model.
- **Validation**: Used for model evaluation while tuning hyperparameters; often implicitly split via cross-validation.
- **Test**: Entirely held-out from model training/tuning; used to provide a unbiased evaluation of the final model. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.height = "70%", out.width = "70%"}
include_graphics("datasplit_val.png")
```

.footnote[
[1] More details on model training and cross-validation methods to come tomorrow in section 2-B.
]
---
##Simple Train/Test Split in R

Use the `createDataPartition()` function in {caret} to create balanced training and testing splits based on the outcome variable. Random sampling occurs within each factor level to ![:emphasize](maintain class distribution) in the datasets. 

Specify the proportion of data you want in the training split (e.g., `p = 0.8`) for an 80%/20% data split.

Remember to set a seed so your results are ![:emphasize](reproducible)!

--

</br> 
```{r}
library(caret)
set.seed(2021)
trainIndex <- createDataPartition(iris$Species, p = .8,
                                  list = FALSE, 
                                  times = 1)
```

---
##Simple Train/Test Split in R

Use the `createDataPartition` row indices to split your data into single train and test sets.

```{r}
irisTrain <- iris[trainIndex, ]
irisTest <- iris[-trainIndex, ]
```

--

Now 80% of the data is designated for model training and can be used for exploratory data analysis. 20% of the data is ![:emphasize](held out and should not be explored) before testing the model, to avoid overly optimistic results. 

```{r}
dim(irisTrain)
dim(irisTest)
```

##Data distributions and error detection

.left-column[
</br>
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.height = 350}
include_graphics("normal_dist.png")
```

]
.right-column[
Typically, the first step in exploratory data analysis is to explore data distributions.

This provides insight into:

- Whether features are normally distributed
- Concerning or extreme skewness 
- Potential data anomalies or errors 
- Data outliers 
- Features with low variance
- Imbalanced data (categorical variables)

Methods:
- Summary statistics
- Histograms
- Bar charts
]

---
##Data distributions and error detection in R

The `dfsummary()` function from {summarytools} is useful for quickly identifying trends and anomalies at a glance. 

--

```{r, eval= FALSE}
print(dfSummary(irisTrain), method = 'render')
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
print(dfSummary(irisTrain, headings = FALSE, style = 'grid', 
                plain.ascii = FALSE, graph.magnif = 0.85, tmp.img.dir = "/tmp"),
      max.tbl.height = 300, method = 'render')
```

---
##Data distributions and error detection in R

Overlaying distributions on the same plot can also be helpful. We can use the `featurePlot()` function in {caret}.

--

```{r, echo = FALSE}
par(bg = "#E9ECEF")
transparentTheme(trans = .9)
```


```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="60%"}
# basic density plot
featurePlot(x = irisTrain[, 1:4], y = irisTrain$Species, plot = 'density')
```

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="60%"}
# make it prettier: free x & y axis, add legend, change plot character
featurePlot(x = irisTrain[, 1:4], y = irisTrain$Species, plot = 'density', 
            scales = list(x = list(relation = "free"), y = list(relation = "free")), 
            adjust = 1.5, pch = "|", auto.key = list(columns = 3))
```

##Are there data anomalies, errors, or outliers?

Check data distributions and summary statistics for:
- Extreme values
- Nonsensical values
- Inconsistencies 
- Low variance
- You may need to adjust plot margins or axes!

# Exploratory Data Analysis
## Missing Data

---
##A technical explanation of missing data

**Missing completely at random (MCAR)**
- No systematic pattern of missing data; the probability of an observation being missing does not depend on any observed or missing data values. 
- E.g., If a weighing scale sometimes runs out of batter, missing data on weight is only due to bad luck and not any measured or missing data.

**Missing at random (MAR)** 
- Systematic relationship between missing values and the *observed* data, but *not* the missing data.
- E.g., If people with eating disorders are more likely to decline being weighed, missing data on weight is systematically related to eating disorder diagnosis.

**Missing not at random (MNAR)**
- Systematic relationship between missing values and those values themselves. 
- E.g., If people with higher weights are more likely to decline being weighed, missing data on weight is systematically related to *weight itself*.

The {VIM} package is particularly helpful for visualizing patterns of missing data.

Two helpful questions to guide missing data visualization:
- Which variables have missing observations (and how many)?
- Does missing data in one variable depend on other variables?

---
##Missing data visualization in R

**Aggregation plots** are useful for inspecting the prevalence of missing data. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
load("biopics.RData")
```


```{r,  out.height = "75%", out.width = "75%", fig.align='center'}
aggr(biopics, numbers = TRUE, prop = c(TRUE, FALSE), col = c("bisque2","darkcyan"))
```

.footnote[

]

---
##Missing data visualization in R

We also want to know if missing data systematically vary by other observed data. If the other data are numeric we use a **spinogram**; if categorical we can use a **spineplot**.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results = 'hide', out.height = "70%", out.width = "70%", fig.align='center'}
spineMiss(biopics[, c("sub_race", "earnings")], col = c("bisque2","darkcyan"))
```

.footnote[

]

---
##Missing data visualization in R

Let's flip the two variables to ask: does the percentage of missing data in `sub_race` differ by `earnings`?

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results = 'hide', out.height = "75%", out.width = "75%", fig.align='center'}
spineMiss(biopics[, c("earnings", "sub_race")], col = c("bisque2","darkcyan"))
```

.footnote[

]

---
##Missing data visualization in R

**Mosiac plots** generalize spineplots and spinograms (which only plot two variables at a time) to multiple variables.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
biopics <- biopics %>% mutate(US_movie = ifelse(grepl("US", country), TRUE, FALSE))
```


```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results = 'hide', out.height = "70%", out.width = "70%", fig.align='center'}
mosaicMiss(biopics[, c("sub_sex", "US_movie", "earnings")], highlight = 3, 
           plotvars = 1:2, miss.labels = FALSE, col = c("bisque2","darkcyan"))
```

.footnote[

]

---
##Missing data visualization in R

**Parallel coordinate plots** allow us to look at patterns of missingness across the entire dataset.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results = 'hide', out.height = "75%", out.width = "75%", fig.align='center'}
parcoordMiss(biopics, highlight = 'earnings', alpha = 0.6, col = c("bisque2","darkcyan"))

##Feature covariation and correlations

.left-column[
</br>
```{r, echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("correlation_meme.png")
```
]
.right-column[
In addition to exploring variation *within* features, we should also explore the covariation that occurs (1) *between* features and (2) between features and labels.

This provides insight into: 
- Highly correlated features (multicollinearity)
- Potential clusters of features that could be reduced into a single feature
- Features with strong relationships to the outcome (feature selection)

Methods:
- Correlation matrices
- Correlation matrices with clustering
- Scatterplot matrices

# Exploratory Data Analysis
## Linearity and Nonlinearity

---
##Linearity and nonlinearity 

Nonlinearity between features and outcome variables are important to pay attention to, because these data patterns inform algorithm selection. 

While some algorithms (e.g., decision trees, random forests) can capture and model nonlinearity, other algorithms (e.g., lasso, ridge, elastic net) cannot. 

The specific **form** of nonlinearity is also important. 

.pull-left[
```{r, echo = FALSE}
par(bg = "#E9ECEF")
feature <- rnorm(1000, 0, 1)
outcome <- feature^2 + runif(1000, -0.2, 0.2)
plot(feature, outcome, cex.lab = 2)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo = FALSE}
par(bg = "#E9ECEF")
feature <- rnorm(1000, 0, 1)
outcome <- 0.4 * (feature)^3 + 0.2* (feature)^2 + runif(1000, -0.2, 0.2)
for (i in 1:1000){
  if (feature[i] < -1.4) {
    outcome[i] = feature^2 + runif(1000, -0.2, 0.2)
  }
}
plot(feature, outcome, cex.lab = 2)
```
]
---
##Linearity and nonlinearity in R

We can use the `featurePlot()` function in `caret` to look for nonlinearities between features and outcomes.

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = FALSE}
data(affect)
affect <- dplyr::rename(affect, neuroticism = neur, positiveAffect = PA1)
theme1 <- trellis.par.get()
theme1$plot.symbol$col = rgb(.2, .2, .2, .4)
theme1$plot.symbol$pch = 16
theme1$plot.line$col = rgb(1, 0, 0, .7)
theme1$plot.line$lwd <- 2
trellis.par.set(theme1)
```

```{r, out.width = "80%", fig.align='center'}
featurePlot(x = affect[, c(4, 8, 12, 20)], y = affect$NA1, plot = "scatter",
            type = c("p", "smooth"), labels = c("Feature", "Negative Affect"))

##Small Group Activity

We will assign you to a small breakout room.

We will jump between rooms to join discussions and answer questions.

![:emphasize](Please work through the Day 1-B activity to practice data splitting and EDA.)

Our goal is for everyone to gain experience with all modeling processes, so everyone should work ![:emphasize](individually) on their own code, rather than assign one person to share their screen and do the coding. However, please feel free to discuss the topics covered with your group members - we hope you also learn from each other! 

If you're stuck or have questions, please post them in the chat or workshop Slack channel, and feel free to consult your group members.
