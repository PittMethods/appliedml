# Motivation

There are **several steps** in the machine learning workflow.

These include data exploration, engineering, model development, and evaluation.

We have a ![:emphasize](finite amount of data) to work with for each of these taks.

--

<p style="padding-top:30px;">Reusing the same data for multiple tasks increases risk of **overfitting**.

It also reduces **generalizability** to future datasets or prediction problems.

We may not get a **true picture** of our model's accuracy or effectiveness.

---
class: twocol
# A Data Budget

.left-column[
<br />
```{r spending, echo=FALSE}
include_graphics('../figs/spending.jpg')
```
]

.right-column[

Using all the data at once **causes many problems in ML**.

However, these can be addressed by **budgeting our data**.

We can **spend our data** on different tasks in the ML workflow.

This is particularly important in **model development to evaluation**.

In smaller datasets, there may be **overlap** in how we spend our data.

We need **strong methods** for how to spend data in different tasks.

# Avoiding Data Leaks

.left-column[
<br />
```{r, echo=FALSE}
include_graphics('../figs/leak.jpg')
```
]

.right-column[

All data is a mix of the true data-generating process **and random noise**.

The modeling process includes many **decision points**. 

Which features to include? What algorithm to use?

There is risk of ![:emphasize](leaking information) from model training to evaluation.

This artificially **inflates optimism about model accuracy**.

Carefully spending data for training or testing prevents ![:emphasize](data leakage).

# Countering Overfitting

class: onecol
# Cross-Validation
There are some clever algorithmic tricks to prevent overfitting

- For example, we can penalize the model for adding complexity

The main approach, however, is to use ![:emphasize](cross-validation):

--

- Multiple **fully independent** sets of data are created (by subsetting or resampling)

- Some sets are used for training (and tuning) and other sets are used for testing

- **Model evaluation is always done on data that were not used to train the model**

- This way, if performance looks good, we can worry less about variance/overfitting<sup>1</sup>

# Simple Random Split

The simplest way to perform **holdout cross-validation** is by randomly splitting the data. 

One portion of the data is allocated for model training, and another for testing. 

Deciding on the proportion of data to split is very context-dependent.

--

<p style="padding-top:30px;">Too little data in the training set makes it difficult to **accurately estimate parameters**.

Too little data in the test set reduces **quality of model performance estimates**.

--

.bg-light-green.b--dark-green.ba.bw1.br3.pl4[
**Advice:** A good default is to allocate 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing.
]

# Simple Random Split in R

.left-column[
<br />
```{r, echo = FALSE}
include_graphics('../figs/rsample.png')
```
]

.right-column[
We will use the {rsample} package from {tidymodels}. 

The `initial_split()` function was built for this purpose.

Its simplest use case requires 2 arguments: 

- `data`: the dataframe to be split.
- `prop`: the proportion of data to be used for training.
]
 
---
class: onecol
# Simple Random Split in R
```{r, message = FALSE}
# set random seed so results are reproducible
set.seed(1234) 

# create and save an 80/20 data split
titanic_split_simple <- initial_split(data = titanic, prop = 0.80)
titanic_split_simple
```

This output shows the amount of training, testing, and total data.

The resulting `initial_split` object **only contains partitioning information**.

---
class: onecol
# Simple Random Split in R

To get the actual training and testing data subsets, we need two more functions.

We will use the `training()` and `testing()` functions, also from {rsample}.

```{r, message = FALSE}
titanic_train_simple <- training(titanic_split_simple)
titanic_test_simple <- testing(titanic_split_simple)

dim(titanic_train_simple)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# convert survived to factor 
titanic_train_simple<- titanic_train_simple %>% 
  mutate(survived = as.factor(survived), traintest = 'train', split = 'simple')
titanic_test_simple <- titanic_test_simple %>% 
  mutate(survived = as.factor(survived), traintest = 'test', split = 'simple')
```

class: onecol
# Stratified Sampling 

While simple random sampling is sometimes sufficient, there are often exceptions. 

**Class imbalance**<sup>1</sup> (classification) and highly **skewed data** (regression) may cause issues.

Most machine learning algorithms work best when classes are of equal size. 

.footnote[
[1] Class imbalance refers to a categorical variable in which one class occurs much more frequently than others (e.g., a dataset with 90% healthy cases and 10% disease cases).
]

--

<p style="padding-top:30px;"> Random sampling may result in vastly **different distributions** between data subsets.

This can result in poor model performance (particularly for the **minority class**). 

It is important for data subsets to be representative of the whole dataset.

---
class: onecol
# Stratified Sampling

As a solution, ![:emphasize](stratified sampling) can be used instead of simple random sampling. 

For classification problems, we conduct **data splits separately within each class**. 

For regression problems, we **bin the outcome into quartiles** and sample within each.

--

<p style="padding-top:30px;">These **stratified samples are combined** together for overall training and testing sets. 

This ensures that the **distribution of the outcome variable** is preserved.

--

.bg-light-yellow.b--light-red.ba.bw1.br3.pl4[
**Caution:** We still need to ensure the sample distribution matches the population!
]

---
class: onecol
# Stratified Sampling in R

To create a stratified random sample, we can use the same `initial_split()` function.

We will use the `strata` argument to name the variable to stratify on.

```{r, message = FALSE}
set.seed(1234)

titanic_split_strat <- initial_split(data = titanic, prop = 0.8, 
                                     strata = 'survived')
titanic_train_strat <- training(titanic_split_strat)
titanic_test_strat <- testing(titanic_split_strat)

dim(titanic_train_strat)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
titanic_train_strat <- titanic_train_strat %>% 
  mutate(survived = as.factor(survived), traintest = 'train', split = 'strat')
titanic_test_strat <- titanic_test_strat %>% 
  mutate(survived = as.factor(survived), traintest = 'test', split = 'strat')
```

# Additional Considerations

class: twocol
# What about Validation Sets?

.left-column[
<br />
```{r, echo=FALSE}
include_graphics('../figs/validation.png')
```
]

.right-column[
We don't have to **wait until the test set** to evaluate our model.

It can be helpful to get a performance estimate **during model training**.

![:emphasize](Validation sets)<sup>1</sup> provide a third split of the dataset to do so.

This can warn us about **overfitting** before we get to the test set.

This is most often useful when tuning model **hyperparameters**.

Validation sets can also be embedded in more **advanced CV methods**.

.footnote[
"Testing" and "validation" sets are often used interchangeably, but they refer to different splits of the data that are used for different purposes.
]
]

---
class: twocol
# What about Multilevel Data?

.left-column[
<br />
```{r, echo=FALSE}
include_graphics('../figs/multilevel.png')
```
]

.right-column[
Observations in multilevel data are not ![:emphasize](independent). 

**Random resampling of rows** may cause biased train/test sets.

For instance, some patients from hospital 1 may be in the training set and others in the testing set. 

Resampling should occur at the **level of the experimental unit**.

In this case, resampling would occur at the level of **hospitals**. 
]

---
class: twocol
# What about Time Series Data?

.left-column[
<br />
```{r, echo=FALSE}
include_graphics('../figs/validation.png')
```
]

.right-column[
Random resampling is also not appropriate for **time series data**.

![:emphasize](Data from the future) can't be used to predict the past! 

Rather, it is typical to use the most **recent data** for a test set. 

The {rsample} package has a function for **splitting time series data**.

`initial_time_split()`:
- `data`: dataset
- `prop`: proportion of first part of data for training
- `lag`: lag value if using lagged predictors 
]

# Coming Soon (Preview)

Today we reviewed the rationale for ![:emphasize](separating model training from model testing). 

We learned various methods for **holdout cross-validation (CV)**: 
- Simple random split
- Stratified sampling
- Validation set
- Multilevel data
- Time series data

However, in practice, we might not want to limit ourselves to a **single test set**. 

What if we could create **multiple test sets** to evaluate our model many times? 

Tomorrow will cover advanced methods for **k-fold CV** and **nested CV**.
