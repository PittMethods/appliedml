# Overview

class: onecol
## Plan for Today

Thus far, we have learned {rsample}, {workflows}, {recipes}, {yardstick}, and {parsnip}.

This lecture aims to tie it all together and .imp[build a model from start to finish].

--

<p style="padding-top:30px;">We will tackle a classification problem by **adapt familiar (statistical) algorithms** to a predictive modeling framework.

This will **ease the transition to ML** and highlight its similarities with classical statistics.

Finally, we will have a **hands-on coding activity** for you to build your own predictive model from scratch.

---
class: onecol
## Applied Example

Let's put what we learned into practice in R! 

Let's train a classification model on the `titanic` data to predict survival.

--

<p style="padding-top:30px;">We will: 

- Load the data

- Create a recipe for feature engineering

- Train a classification model to predict if each passanger survived the titanic

- Evaluate the model using 10-fold cross-validation 

- Interpret the model 

---
class: onecol
## Load Data and Create Recipe

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(tidymodels)
titanic <- read.csv("https://tinyurl.com/titanic-pm")

survived_recipe <- 
  titanic %>% 
  recipe(survived ~ .) %>% 
  step_mutate(survived = factor(survived),
              pclass = factor(pclass, levels = c(1, 2, 3)),
              sex = factor(sex, levels = c("female", "male"))) %>% 
  step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors()) %>%
  step_dummy(pclass, sex) %>%
  step_impute_linear(age, fare) %>%
  step_nzv(all_predictors()) %>%
  step_corr(all_predictors()) %>%
  step_lincomb(all_predictors())
```

---
class: onecol
## Specify Model with {parsnip}

```{r}
# Specify Model
log_reg <- logistic_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("glm") %>%
  set_mode("classification")

log_reg
```

---
class: onecol
## Build Workflow with {workflows}

.scroll70[
```{r}
survived_workflow <- 
  workflow() %>%
  add_model(log_reg) %>%
  add_recipe(survive_recipe)

survived_workflow
```
]

---
class: onecol
## Fit Model with Resampling

```{r}
set.seed(2022)

# configure resampling
survived_folds <- vfold_cv(data = titanic, 
                           v = 10, 
                           repeats = 3,
                           strata = 'survived')
```

---
class: onecol
## Fit Model with Resampling

Because the goal of `fit_resamples()` is to .imp[measure model importance], the models trained are not saved or used later by default.

To save model coefficients from each resample, we need to .imp[extract] the underlying model object (i.e., the engine fit). 

This can be done with a custom function, and specified in `control_resamples()`: 

--

```{r}
get_glm_coefs <- function(x) {
  x %>% 
    # get the lm model object
    extract_fit_engine() %>% 
    # transform its format
    tidy()
}

# save predictions from resampling
keep_pred <- control_resamples(save_pred = TRUE, extract = get_lm_coefs)
```

---
class: onecol
## Fit Model with Resampling

Now that we have set up the workflow and configured resampling, we are ready to fit the model! 

--

```{r}
# train the model using the recipe, data, and method 
survived_results <- survived_workflow %>%
  fit_resamples(resamples = survived_folds, control = keep_pred)
```

---
class: twocol
## Fit Model with Resampling

.pull-left[
```{r, echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("../figs/kfold5.png")
```
]

.pull-right[
Note: we are resampling the **entire data set**.

This means that we only have training and test sets (N = 30). 

We have no separate validation sets. 

Model evaluation will occur for each cross-validated test set. 

We will average performance metrics, and use these to evaluate the model.

# Model Evaluation

class: onecol
## Cross-Validated Test Performance

The object created by `fit_resamples()` will contain lots of information.

We can view the predictions made in each cross-validated test set with `collect_predictions()`.

--

```{r, eval = FALSE}
collect_predictions(popular_results)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
collect_predictions(popular_results) %>% kable() %>% scroll_box(height = "250px")
```

---
class: onecol
## Cross-Validated Test Performance 

We can plot these predictions against the observed values.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
popular_predictions <- collect_predictions(popular_results)

popular_predictions %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = popularity, y = .pred)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .15) + 
  geom_abline(color = 'red')
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
config <-   
  theme_xaringan(text_font_size = 14, title_font_size = 18,
                 css_file = "xaringan-themer.css") +
  theme(
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white")
  )

popular_predictions <- collect_predictions(popular_results)

popular_predictions %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = popularity, y = .pred)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .15) + 
  geom_abline(color = 'red') + 
  coord_obs_pred() + 
  ylab("Predicted") + 
  xlab("Observed") + 
  config
```

---
class: onecol
## Cross-Validated Test Performance

We can view a summary of training set performance with `collect_metrics()`.

These results include the mean and standard error of each metric across resamples<sup>1</sup>.

.footnote[
[1] To see metrics for each fold, include `summarize = FALSE` in `collect_metrics()`.
]

--

```{r, eval = FALSE}
collect_metrics(popular_results)
```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
collect_metrics(popular_results) %>% kable()
```

## Model Interpretation 

Predictive **accuracy** is emphasized in ML over interpretability and inference

- The main goal of most applied ML studies is to **quantify performance**

--

However, some algorithms can provide insight into their decision-making

- As a model usually used for inference, linear regression has strong interpretability

- We can examine the model coefficients (intercept and slopes)

The `get_lm_coefs()` function we wrote earlier will allow us to do this!

---
class: onecol
## Model Interpretation

Extracting the coefficients we need is a bit messy.

Let's take a look at the output from our resampled model `popular_results`:

--

```{r, eval = FALSE}
popular_results
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
popular_results %>% kable() %g it>% scroll_box(height = "300px")
```

---
class: onecol
## Variable Importance

We can also plot variable importance using the {vip} package.

```{r, out.width = "50%"}
#library(vip)
#vip(fare_fit)
```

.footnote[
Other algorithms have different ways to estimate variable importance, but `vip()` will take care of it.
]


---
class: onecol
## A Final Model

Importantly, the goal of `fit_resamples()` is to .imp[measure model importance].

The models trained in `fit_resamples()` are not saved or used later. 

It also doesn't perform hyperparameter tuning (which we will learn about tomorrow).

--

<p style="padding-top:30px;"> We need a **final model** for interpretation and prediction on new data. 

For OLS regression, so we can go back and fit a model on the entire data set.

For tuning hyperparameters, we first use `tune_grid()` and then fit a final model.
