# Overview

class: onecol
## Motivation

There are **several steps** in the machine learning workflow.

These include data exploration, engineering, model development, and evaluation.

We have a .imp[finite amount of data] to work with for each of these tasks.

--

<p style="padding-top:30px;">Reusing the same data for multiple tasks increases risk of .imp[overfitting].

<p style="padding-top:30px;">Reusing the same data for multiple tasks increases risk of .imp[overfitting].

It also reduces **generalizability** to future datasets or prediction problems.

We may not get a **true understanding** of our model's accuracy or effectiveness.

## A Data Budget

.left-column.pv3[
```{r spending, echo=FALSE}
include_graphics('../figs/spending.jpg')
```
]

.right-column[

Using all the data at once **causes many problems in ML**.

However, these can be addressed by **budgeting our data**.

We can **spend our data** on different tasks in the ML workflow.

This is particularly important in **model development to evaluation**.

In smaller datasets, there may be **overlap** in how we spend our data.

We need **strong methods** for how to spend data in different tasks.

class: twocol
## Avoiding Data Leaks

.left-column.pv3[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
include_graphics('../figs/leak.jpg')
```
]

.right-column[

All data is a mix of the true data-generating process and random noise<sup>1</sup>.

The modeling process includes many **decision points**. 

Which features to include? What algorithm to use?

There is risk of .imp[leaking information] from model training to evaluation.

This artificially **inflates optimism about model accuracy**.

Carefully spending data for training or testing prevents .imp[data leakage].

]

.footnote[
[1] *Data generating process* refers to the signal we want to capture - the underlying processes that gives rise to the data that we observe. *Random noise* refers to error (e.g., sampling error) we do not want to model.

# Countering Overfitting

---
class: onecol
## Cross-Validation
There are some clever algorithmic tricks to prevent overfitting

- For example, we can penalize the model for adding complexity

The main approach, however, is to use .imp[cross-validation]:

--

- Multiple **fully independent** sets of data are created (by subsetting or resampling)

- Some sets are used for training (and tuning) and other sets are used for testing

- **Model evaluation is always done on data that were not used to train the model**

- This way, if performance looks good, we can worry less about variance/overfitting

## Simple Random Split

The simplest way to perform **holdout cross-validation** is by randomly splitting the data. 

One portion of the data is allocated for model training, and another for testing. 

Deciding on the proportion of data to split is very context-dependent.

--

<p style="padding-top:30px;">Too little data in the training set makes it difficult to **accurately estimate parameters**.

Too little data in the test set reduces **quality of model performance estimates**.

--

.bg-light-green.b--dark-green.ba.bw1.br3.ph4[
**Advice:** It is common to use 80% for training and 20% for testing.

## Simple Random Split in R

.left-column[
<br />
```{r, echo = FALSE}
include_graphics('../figs/rsample.png')
```
]

.right-column[
We will use the {rsample} package from {tidymodels}. 

The `initial_split()` function was built for this purpose.

Its simplest use case requires 2 arguments: 

- `data`: the dataframe to be split.
- `prop`: the proportion of data to be used for training.
]
 
---
class: onecol
## Live Coding: Simple Random Split in R
```{r, message = FALSE}
# set random seed so results are reproducible
set.seed(2022) 

# create and save an 80/20 data split
titanic_split_simple <- initial_split(data = titanic, prop = 0.80)
```

--

<p style="padding-top:30px;">This output shows the amount of training, testing, and total data.

The resulting `initial_split` object **only contains partitioning information**.

---
class: onecol
## Live Coding: Simple Random Split in R

To get the actual training and testing data subsets, we need two more functions.

We will use the `training()` and `testing()` functions, also from {rsample}.

--

```{r, message = FALSE}
# create training set 
titanic_train_simple <- training(titanic_split_simple)

# create testing set 
titanic_test_simple <- testing(titanic_split_simple)
```

---
class: onecol
## Stratified Sampling 

While simple random sampling is sometimes sufficient, there are often exceptions. 

**Class imbalance**<sup>1</sup> (classification) and highly **skewed data** (regression) may cause issues.

Most machine learning algorithms work best when classes are of equal size. 

.footnote[
[1] Class imbalance refers to a categorical variable in which one class occurs much more frequently than others (e.g., a dataset with 90% healthy cases and 10% disease cases).
]

--

<p style="padding-top:30px;"> Random sampling may result in vastly **different distributions** between data subsets.

This can result in poor model performance (particularly for the **minority class**). 

It is important for data subsets to be representative of the whole dataset.

---
class: onecol
## Stratified Sampling

As a solution, .imp[stratified sampling] can be used instead of simple random sampling. 

For classification problems, we conduct **data splits separately within each class**. 

For regression problems, we **bin the outcome into quartiles** and sample within each.

--

<p style="padding-top:30px;">These **stratified samples are combined** together for overall training and testing sets. 

This ensures that the **distribution of the outcome variable** is preserved.

--

.bg-light-yellow.b--light-red.ba.bw1.br3.ph4[
**Caution:** We still need to ensure the sample distribution matches the population!
]

---
class: onecol
## Live Coding: Stratified Sampling in R

To create a stratified random sample, we can use the same `initial_split()` function.

We will use the `strata` argument to name the variable to stratify on.

--

```{r, message = FALSE}
set.seed(2022)

# create initial stratified split
titanic_split_strat <- initial_split(data = titanic, 
                                     prop = 0.8, 
                                     strata = 'survived')

# create training and testing sets
titanic_train_strat <- training(titanic_split_strat)
titanic_test_strat <- testing(titanic_split_strat)
```

# Additional Considerations

class: twocol
## What about Validation Sets?

.left-column[
<br />
```{r, echo=FALSE}
include_graphics('../figs/validation.png')
```
]

.right-column[
We don't have to **wait until the test set** to evaluate our model.

It can be helpful to get a performance estimate **during model training**.

.imp[Validation sets]<sup>1</sup> provide a third split of the dataset to do so.

This can warn us about **overfitting** before we get to the test set.

This is most often useful when tuning model **hyperparameters**.

Validation sets can also be embedded in more **advanced CV methods**.

.footnote[
"Testing" and "validation" sets are often used interchangeably, but they refer to different splits of the data that are used for different purposes.
]
]

---
class: twocol
## What about Multilevel Data?

.left-column[
<br />
```{r, echo=FALSE}
include_graphics('../figs/multilevel.png')
```
]

.right-column[
Observations in multilevel data are not .imp[independent]. 

**Random resampling of rows** may cause biased train/test sets<sup>1</sup>.

Resampling should occur at the **level of the experimental unit**.

In this case, resampling would be at the level of **hospitals**. 

{tidymodels} has a development version of a function to create an initial split of multilevel data.

]

.footnote[
[1] For example, some patients from hospital 1 may end up in the training set and others in the testing set).
]

---
class: onecol
## What about Multilevel Data?

You can access the development function `group_initial_split()` from [github](https://github.com/tidymodels/rsample).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_dev("rsample")
```

--

<p style="padding-top:30px;">The `group_initial_split()` function has three arguments:
- `data`: dataset

- `group`: group to split on (e.g.. hospitals)

- `prop`: proportion of data to use for training


---
class: twocol
## What about Time Series Data?

.left-column[
<br />
```{r, echo=FALSE}
include_graphics('../figs/time.png')
```
]

.right-column[
Random resampling is also not appropriate for **time series data**.

.imp[Data from the future] can't be used to predict the past! 

Rather, it is typical to use the most **recent data** for a test set. 
]

## Coming Soon (Preview)

Today we reviewed the rationale for .imp[separating model training from model testing]. 

We learned various methods for **holdout cross-validation (CV)**: 
- Simple random split
- Stratified sampling
- Validation set
- Multilevel data
- Time series data

However, in practice, we might not want to limit ourselves to a **single test set**. 

What if we could create **multiple test sets** to evaluate our model many times? 

Tomorrow will cover advanced methods for **k-fold CV** and **nested CV**.
