# Linear Regression Review

---
## Linear Regression 

Linear regression and closely related models (ridge, lasso, elastic net, etc.) can all be written in the form: 

`$$y_i = b_0 + b_1x_{i1} + b_2x_{i2} + ... + b_Px_{iP} + e_i$$`

where

- `\(y_i\)`: value of the response for the `\(i\)`th observation
- `\(b_0\)`: estimated intercept 
- `\(b_j\)`: estimated coefficient for the `\(j\)`th predictor
- `\(x_{ij}\)`: value of the `\(j\)`th predictor for the `\(i\)`th observation
- `\(e_i\)`: random error unexplained by the model

--

Such models are ![:emphasize](linear in the parameters) because each parameter (e.g., `\(b_1\)`, `\(b_2\)`, etc.) appears only with a power of 1 and is not multipled or divided by any other parameter. 

Nonlinear *variables* (e.g., `\(x_1^2\)`) can still be included in linear regression as long as the *parameters* remain linear.

---
## Ordinary Least Squares Regression

In ordinary least squares regression, the parameters (e.g., `\(b_1\)`, `\(b_2\)`, etc.) are estimated to ![:emphasize](minimize model bias at the expense of increasing model variance).

&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;img src="Day_3A_Slides_files/figure-html/complexity-1.png" width="90%" /&gt;

---
##Ordinary Least Squares Regression

Specifically, parameters in OLS regression are chosen to minimize the sum-of-squared errors (SSE):

`$$SSE = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n(y_i - \hat{y_i})^2$$`

where
- `\(n\)`: number of observations 
- `\(y_1\)`: `\(i\)`th observed response
- `\(\hat{y_i}\)`: `\(i\)`th predicted response

&lt;br/&gt;
--

However, any dataset is influenced by both the underlying data-generating mechanisms *and* ![:emphasize](sampling error), which by definition is not shared with other samples drawn from the same population.

##Ordinary Least Squares Regression

&lt;img src="overfit.jpg" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
##Ordinary Least Squares Regression

While OLS regression is readily interpretable and easy to compute, there are several noteworthy limitations:

- Risk of ![:emphasize](overfitting)
- ![:emphasize](Inflated) parameter estimates
- Poor ![:emphasize](predictive accuracy) in new datasets
- Sensitive to ![:emphasize](outliers) (adjusting parameter estimates to better accommodate outlier observations with large residuals in order to minimize SSE)
- Cannot handle datasets with high ![:emphasize](multicollinearity)
- Cannot handle datasets with ![:emphasize](more predictors than observations) 
- May not adequately capture ![:emphasize](nonlinear) relationships&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;sup&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Regularization addresses many (but not all) of these problems.

.footnote[
[1] This remains a problem with regularized regression models, but see methods for adding nonlinearity to linear models in lecture 2-A (Feature Eningeering).

# Regularization

##Why regularize?

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src="overfit_graph.png" width="100%" /&gt;
]
.right-column[
**Reduce Overfitting**

OLS regression models overfit the data and inflate parameter estimates.

Regularized regression adds an additional ![:emphasize](penalty term) to the error function, which constrains parameter estimates and penalizes model complexity.

Compared to OLS regression models, regularized regression models have a ![:emphasize](higher bias) but ![:emphasize](lower variance).

In essense, we make our model less sensitive to the data in the training set in order to achieve higher accuracy in the test set.

##Why regularize?
.left-column[
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src="feature_selection.png" width="100%" /&gt;
]
.right-column[
**Feature Selection**

We are often interested in finding a subset of 'good' predictors.

However, there are are many problems&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; with the traditional approach of stepwise regression models.

One benefit of regularization is that it shrinks parameter estimates towards zero. In some cases, such as lasso regression, some parameters are ![:emphasize](actually set to zero).

Thus, regularization models can simultaneously reduce overfitting and perform feature selection.

# Ridge Regression

## Ridge Regression

Recall the SSE error function for OLS regression: 

`$$SSE = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n(y_i - \hat{y_i})^2$$`

--

Ridge regression adds a penalty term to this function known as the `\(L_2\)` penalty: 

`$$SSE_{L2} = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n(y_i - \hat{y_i})^2 + \lambda \sum\limits_{j = 1}^P \beta_j^2$$`
where
- `\(n\)`: number of observations 
- `\(y_1\)`: `\(i\)`th observed response
- `\(\hat{y_i}\)`: `\(i\)`th predicted response
- `\(P\)`: number of parameters 
- `\(\beta_j\)`: the `\(j\)`th parameter

---
## Ridge Regression
.left-column[
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src="ridge.png" width="100%" /&gt;
]
.right-column[
Whereas OLS regression minimizes the difference between the observed and predicted data, ridge regression has an additional goal of ![:emphasize](minimizing) `\(\color{darkred}\lambda\)` ![:emphasize](* the squared value of all parameter estimates).

Thus, parameter estimates in ridge regression are only able to become large if there is a proportional reduction in `\(SSE_{L2}\)`. 

The `\(\lambda\)` parameter is a ![:emphasize](hyperparameter) controlling the degree of regularization that ranges from [0, inf].

At higher values of `\(\lambda\)`, parameters will be shrunk closer to zero.

We can find the 'best' value of `\(\lambda\)` through cross-validation hyperparameter tuning.

## Ridge Regression in R


**Step 0: Split into a training (including cross-validation) and held-out test set.**


```r
# use caret for simple data split
library(caret)
set.seed(2021)
trainIndex &lt;- createDataPartition(EDsim$ED_severity, p = 0.8, list = FALSE, times = 1)
EDsim_train &lt;- EDsim[trainIndex, ]
EDsim_test &lt;- EDsim[-trainIndex, ]
```

--


```r
# check data splitting
dim(EDsim_train)
```

```
## [1] 400  20
```

```r
dim(EDsim_test)
```

```
## [1] 100  20
```

## Ridge Regression in R 

**Step 1: Exploratory Data Analysis**
&lt;img src="Day_3A_Slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="100%" /&gt;

---
## Ridge Regression in R

**Step 2: Feature Engineering**&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. 

Normalizing (standardizing) features before regularization is important to ensure that the shrinkage parameter `\(\lambda\)` affects all features equally.



```r
EDsim_recipe &lt;- 
  EDsim_train %&gt;% 
  recipe(ED_severity ~ .) %&gt;%
  step_rm(ED_diagnosis) %&gt;%
* step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors()) %&gt;%
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) 
```

.footnote[
[1] Note than when using `recipes`, dummy variables should be created manually with `step_dummy`. If using `caret` by itself without `recipes`, dummy variables are created automatically. 
]

---
## Ridge Regression in R 

**Step 3: Set model training and tuning methods in `caret::traincontrol()`**


```r
EDsim_control &lt;- trainControl(method = 'repeatedcv',
                              number = 10,
                              repeats = 3, 
                              classProbs = FALSE,
                              summaryFunction = defaultSummary)
```

&lt;br/&gt;
This sets our up training procedure with the following specifications: 

- 10-fold cross-validation, repeated 3 times
- Other commonly used options include `method = 'cv'` for a single (non-repeated) cross-validation and `method = 'boot'` for bootstrapping
- For classification, set `classProbs = TRUE` and `summaryFunction = twoClassSummary` or `summaryFunction = prSummary`

## Ridge Regression in R 

**Step 4: Set a tuning grid** (optional)

There are several ways to set a tuning grid in `caret`. 

The first option is to do nothing, as `caret` will automatically create a tuning grid if one is not specified. By default, `caret::train()` creates a tuning grid of size `\(3^P\)`, where `\(P\)`is the number of tuning parameters. 

--

The second option is to specify the length of the tuning grid in the `caret::train()` function: 


```r
train(Y ~ X, method = 'glmnet', tuneLength = 10)
```

--

The third option is to specify the grid yourself to call in `caret::train()`:


```r
ridgegrid &lt;- expand.grid(alpha = 0, lambda = seq(0, 1, 0.01))
```

This option is useful for training ridge regression models within the `glmnet` method in `caret`, which allows for nice data visualizations. However, `caret` will automatically create a grid of both `\(\alpha\)` and `\(\lambda\)` values for `method = 'glmnet'`, but we can avoid that by setting the tuning grid ourselves.

## Ridge Regression in R

**Step 5: Train your model using `caret::train()`**


```r
set.seed(2021)
ridgefit &lt;- train(EDsim_recipe, data = EDsim_train,
                  method = 'glmnet',
                  tuneGrid = ridgegrid,
                  trControl = EDsim_control)
```

# Lasso Regression

## Lasso Regression

Lasso stands for the ![:emphasize](Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator). 

Similar to ridge regression, lasso regression adds an additional penalty term (in this case, the `\(L1\)` penalty) to the OLS error function:

`$$SSE_{L1} = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n(y_i - \hat{y_i})^2 + \lambda \sum\limits_{j = 1}^P \lvert \beta_j \rvert$$`
where
- `\(n\)`: number of observations 
- `\(y_1\)`: `\(i\)`th observed response
- `\(\hat{y_i}\)`: `\(i\)`th predicted response
- `\(P\)`: number of parameters 
- `\(\beta_j\)`: the `\(j\)`th parameter

## Lasso Regression

]
.right-column[
Here, we aim to minimize the **absolute value** of all parameters (rather than the square of parameters as with ridge). 

While this may seem like a small change, it has the effect of ![:emphasize](fully penalizing some parameter values down to zero), whereas ridge only shrinks values **towards** zero. 

If `\(\lambda\)` is set high enough, all parameters will be shrunk to zero. 

Ridge and lasso also differ in their handling of **multicollinearity.**

Whereas ridge tends to shrink coefficients of correlated predictors towards each other, lasso tends to **pick one and ignore the rest**.

# Elastic Net Regression

## Elastic Net Regression

Elastic net regression is a generalization of the lasso model, which combines both `\(L1\)` (lasso) and `\(L2\)` (ridge) penalty terms together in the error function:

`$$SSE_{EN} = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n(y_i - \hat{y_i})^2 + \lambda_1 \sum\limits_{j = 1}^P \beta_j^2 + \lambda_2 \sum\limits_{j = 1}^P \lvert \beta_j \rvert$$`

where
- `\(n\)`: number of observations 
- `\(y_1\)`: `\(i\)`th observed response
- `\(\hat{y_i}\)`: `\(i\)`th predicted response
- `\(P\)`: number of parameters 
- `\(\beta_j\)`: the `\(j\)`th parameter

.left-column[
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src="elasticnet.png" width="100%" /&gt;
]
.right-column[
The elastic net model allows for effective ridge-like regularization with lasso-like feature selection.

In `caret`, we now tune two hyperparameters: `\(\lambda\)` and `\(\alpha\)`.

As with ridge and lasso, `\(\lambda\)` controls the degree of regularization. 

The new `\(\alpha\)` hyperparameter is called the ![:emphasize](elastic net mixing parameter), and ranges from [0, 1]. 

At `\(\alpha = 0\)` ridge is performed and at `\(\alpha = 1\)` lasso is performed.  

Elastic net is particularly good at handling correlated predictors.

## Live Coding Activity

**Live Coding**: I will walk through examples of ridge, lasso, and elastic net for classification in RStudio. 

- You can follow along in your own RStudio (easiest with 1 large or 2+ monitors)
- Or you can download `Day_3A_Activity.Rmd` and follow along
- In either case, please download the `heart.csv` and `hcp_memory.csv` files. 

.footnote[
All files are on the workshop OSF page: https://osf.io/3qhc8/.

&lt;/br&gt;

**Small Group Activity**: Afterwards, we will split you into small breakout room groups to practice a full machine learning workflow using a new dataset. 

If you have any questions, please post them in the chat or workshop Slack channel. 

We will also float between different breakout rooms to answer questions.
