# Overview

---
class: onecol
## Motivation

Yesterday, we introduced the rationale for **holdout cross-validation**. 

--

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%"}
include_graphics("../figs/holdout.png")
```

--

This is a good first step! 

However, we often want model performance *before getting to the final test set*.

---
class: onecol
## Plan for Today

Today's focus is on advanced cross-validation methods, including: 

- *k*-fold cross-validation

- repeated *k*-fold cross-validation 

- leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV)

- nested cross-validation

--

All CV methods will be performed with {rsample} and {tune}.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="30%"}
include_graphics('../figs/rsample_tune.png')
```

# k-fold Cross-Validation

## k-fold Cross-Validation
<br>
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "95%"}
include_graphics("../figs/kfold1.png")
```

---
count: false
## k-fold Cross-Validation
.center[
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%"}
include_graphics("../figs/kfold2.png")
```
]

---
class: onecol
## k-fold Cross-Validation

The final resampling performance estimate is averaged across each *k* fold.

k-fold cross-validation can also be .imp[stratified] to keep the sets relatively similar.

k-fold cross-validation can also be .imp[repeated] to avoid problems with any single split.

--

<p style="padding-top:30px;">How many folds should be used in cross-validation?

Larger values of *k* result in resampling estimates with **lower bias** but **higher variance**. 

Smaller values of *k* result in estimates with **higher bias** but **lower variance**.

--

.bg-light-green.b--dark-green.ba.bw1.br3.pl4[
**Advice**: In practice, values of *k* = 5 or *k* = 10 are most common.
]

---
class: onecol
## k-fold Cross-Validation in R 

We will use the `vfold_cv()` function from {rsample}<sup>1</sup>.

Argument | Description
:------- | :----------
data | The data frame
v | The number of partitions to create (default = 10)
repeats | The number of times to repeat the v-fold partitioning (default = 1)
strata | Variable to conduct stratified sampling (default = NULL)


.footnote[
[1] Note that {tidymodels} refers to k-fold as v-fold CV. These refer to the same resampling process!
]

---
class: onecol
## k-fold Cross-Validation in R

Let's perform 10-fold cross-validation repeated 3 times using the `titanic` dataset.

Our goal will be to predict each passenger's fare (how much they paid).

--

.scroll40[
```{r}
library(tidymodels)
titanic <- read.csv("https://tinyurl.com/titanic-pm")

set.seed(2022)

fare_folds <- vfold_cv(titanic, v = 10, repeats = 3, strata = fare)
fare_folds
```
]

--

The `splits` column contains information on how to split the data. 

`[297/33]` indicates N = 297 in the analysis set and N = 33 in that particular k-fold.  

---
class: onecol
## k-fold Cross-Validation in R

We can extract individual resampled data folds with `analysis()` and `assessment()`.

--

.scroll30[
```{r}
fare_folds$splits[[1]] %>% analysis()
```
]

--

.scroll30[
```{r}
fare_folds$splits[[1]] %>% assessment()
```
]

---
class: onecol
## k-fold Cross-Validation in R

However, we generally don't need to extract the individual folds.

{tune} has built-in functions that can use a `vfold_cv` object directly:

- `fit_resamples()` estimates model performance across resamples **with no tuning**.

- `tune_grid()` estimates model performance across resamples **with tuning**.

--

<p style="padding-top:30px;"> Most ML algorithms include .imp[hyperparameters] to be tuned<sup>1</sup> and require `tune_grid()`. 

But we can use `fit_resamples()` for 'traditional' statistical models like OLS regression. 

Luckily, these functions are **nearly identical** so learning one will transfer to the other! 

.footnote[
[1] We will learn our first ML algorithms and tuning tomorrow!
]

---
class: onecol
## Resampling Options 

There are three possible interfaces to `fit_resamples()` and `tune_grid()`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
model_spec %>% fit_resamples(formula, resamples, ...)

model_spec %>% fit_resamples(recipe, resamples, ...)

workflow %>% fit_resamples(resamples, ...)
```

--

There are also a number of optional arguments, including:

- `metrics`: performance statistics to compute<sup>1</sup>

- `control`: a list created by `control_resamples()` or `control_grid()` with various resampling options

.footnote[
[1] Regression default metrics are RMSE and $R^2$. Classification default metrics are AUROC and overall accuracy.
]

---
class: onecol
## Resampling Options 

The `control` argument to `fit_resamples()` can be configured by `control_resamples()`<sup>1</sup>:

Argument | Description
:------- | :----------
verbose | Whether to print progress (default = FALSE) 
save_pred | Whether to save out-of-sample predictions per *k* fold (default = FALSE)
event_level | For classification only; specify which level is considered the "event" (`"first"` or `"second"`)
extract | An optional function to retain model objects

.footnote[
[1] The same list can be created for `tune_grid()` by `control_grid()`.
]

---
class: onecol
## Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation

The most extreme variation of k-fold CV is when $k = N-1$.

This is called .imp[leave-one-out cross-validation].

A model is trained on $N-1$ rows and used to predict a **single held-out observation**.

--

<p style="padding-top:30px;"> The {rsample} package has a `loo_cv()` function that performs LOOCV.

However, these objects are not well integrated into the broader tidymodels framework.

LOOCV is **computationally expensive** and may have poor statistical properties.

--

.bg-light-yellow.b--light-red.ba.bw1.br3.pl4[
LOOCV is not generally recommended. It's usually better to stick with k-fold CV.
]

## Comprehension Check \#1

.pull-left[
### Question 1
**Which is the best data splitting method for ML?**

a) A single training and a single test set

b) *k*-fold cross-validation

c) Repeated *k*-fold cross-validation

d) Leave-one-out cross-validation
]

.pull-right[
### Question 2
**What is stratified *k*-fold cross-validation?**

a) Each *k* fold contains 1/2 of the data

b) Some data are withheld from cross-validation

c) Each *k* fold has a similar distribution of data

d) Multiple iterations of *k* folds are created
]

## Should we use a separate test set?

--

.pull-left[
k-fold CV is often used on a .imp[full data set]. 

**Pro**: All data used for training and testing.

**Con**: No true test set the model hasn't seen.

# Nested Cross-Validation

---
class: onecol
## Nested Cross-Validation 

Nested cross-validation adds an additional layer of resampling. 

This separates the model **tuning**<sup>1</sup> from the model evaluation process.

It also frees us from having to rely on a **single** test set to evaluate our model.

.footnote[
[1] We'll discuss model tuning in detail tomorrow!
]

--

<p style="padding-top:30px;">There are **two layers** of resampling in nested CV.

The .imp[outer loop] splits the full data set into not-testing and testing sets.

The .imp[inner loop] splits the training data set into model training and validation sets.

---
class: onecol
## Nested Cross-Validation

For every split of the outer loop, a **full inner resampling split** is conducted. 

Let's say we use 10-fold CV on the **outer loop** and 5-fold CV on the **inner loop**.

This would be a total of .imp[500 models] being fit! 

--

<p style="padding-top:30px;">In this case, **hyperparameter tuning** is performed within each inner loop.

A model is then **fit to each outer split** with the best parameter from that resample.

Results are averaged across all outer splits for an **unbiased estimate of the model**.

## Nested CV in R: It's Complicated

There is a `nested_cv()` function in {rsample} splits data for nested cross-validation<sup>1</sup>.

Unfortunately, nested cross-validation is not yet **fully supported** 
in tidymodels. 

`fit_resamples()` and `tune_grid()` do not work for nested cross-validation<sup>1</sup>.

If you want to use nested cross-validation, you will need to write your own functions.

.footnote[
[1] Though they work great for regular k-fold CV!
]

--

<p style="padding-top:30px;"> Example code can be found on the [tidymodels website](https://www.tidymodels.org/learn/work/nested-resampling/).

This is a bit complicated, so **we will stick to using repeated k-fold CV** for this course. 

But if you are ready to for a challenge, we highly encourage looking into nested CV!

## Applied Example: Feature Engineering

Let's use `titanic_folds` to fit a resampled model in R predicting `fare`. 

First, we'll make a preprocessing {recipe} (without prepping or baking).

```{r}
fare_recipe <- 
  titanic %>% 
  recipe(fare ~ .) %>% 
  step_rm(survived) %>% 
  step_naomit(fare) %>% 
  step_mutate(pclass = factor(pclass, levels = c(1, 2, 3)),
              sex = factor(sex, levels = c("female", "male"))) %>% 
  step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors()) %>%
  step_dummy(pclass, sex) %>%
  step_impute_linear(age) %>%
  step_nzv(all_predictors()) %>%
  step_corr(all_predictors()) %>%
  step_lincomb(all_predictors())
```

---
class: onecol
## Applied Example: Specify Model and Workflow

Second, we'll specify a linear regression model.

```{r}
reg_freq <- linear_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  set_mode("regression")
```

--

Third, we'll create a {workflow}.

```{r}
fare_workflow <- 
  workflow() %>% 
  add_recipe(fare_recipe) %>% 
  add_model(reg_freq)
```

---
class: onecol
## Applied Example: Fit the Model

Finally, we can fit a resampled model with our {workflow} and `fare_folds`.

```{r}
# configure sampling to save predictions from each k-fold
keep_pred <- control_resamples(save_pred = TRUE)

fare_results <- 
  fare_workflow %>% 
  fit_resamples(resamples = fare_folds, control = keep_pred)
```

---
class: onecol
## Applied Example: Evaluate a Resampled Model

We can evaluate this model with `collect_metrics()`:

```{r}
collect_metrics(fare_results)
```

---
class: onecol
## Applied Example: Evaluate a Resampled Model

We can also plot **predicted** against **observed** values to get a better understanding of model performance:

.pull-left[
```{r, eval = FALSE}
fare_predictions <- collect_predictions(fare_results)

fare_predictions %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = fare, y = .pred)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .15) + 
  geom_abline(color = 'darkred') + 
  coord_obs_pred() + 
  labs(x = "Observed Fare", y = "Predicted Fare")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.show = 'hide'}
config <-   
  theme_xaringan(text_font_size = 14, title_font_size = 18,
                 css_file = "../css/xaringan-themer.css") +
  theme(
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white")
  )

fare_predictions <- collect_predictions(fare_results)

fare_plot_2c <- fare_predictions %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = fare, y = .pred)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .15) + 
  geom_abline(color = 'red') + 
  coord_obs_pred() + 
  ylab("Predicted") + 
  xlab("Observed") + 
  config

ggsave("../figs/fare_pred_2c.png", width = 3.5, height = 3.5, units = 'in')
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="70%"}
include_graphics("../figs/fare_pred_2c.png")
```
